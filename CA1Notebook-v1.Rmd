This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# Import and view data
dataCA1Control <- read.csv("GROUP_3_2023_GCA_RESULTS_CONTROL.csv")
summary(dataCA1Control)

```


```{r}
# Remove negative values
pretrial_GAD <- c(dataCA1Control$pretrial_GAD)
pretrial_GAD

```


```{r}
Pos_pretrial_GAD <- pretrial_GAD[pretrial_GAD >= 0]
Pos_pretrial_GAD

```


```{r}
# Histogram of positive pretrial GAD values
hist(Pos_pretrial_GAD)

```
```{r}
# Check data is numeric
is.numeric(dataCA1Control)

```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
