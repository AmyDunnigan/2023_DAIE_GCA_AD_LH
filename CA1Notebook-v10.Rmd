### Abstract

#### Aim and Rationale
The Aim of this study is to research a possibility of a more effective way to treat anxiety 
disorder using virtual headsets and environments.

#### Participants and setting
The study consisted of 180 participants divided into control and experimental groups. The participants were 
randomly sampled from the clinic client list and randomly assigned to the 2 groups. The participants were 
all ages between 18 - 40 years.

#### Experiment design
The 2 groups underwent 12 weeks of treatment for 50 minutes per week with a therapist. 
During that time the participants underwent either traditional CBT or used the VR app.

#### Results gathering
The results were gathered using the self-report mechanism at the beginning and end of the study.

#### Findings/Implications


### Introduction
#### Topic and context
As of 2019, according to the World Health Organization, approximately 301 million people worldwide suffer
from anxiety disorders. Anxiety disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by feelings of anxiety
and fear. These feelings may cause physical symptoms such as a racing heart and shakiness. Anxiety is a
natural response to stress, but for individuals with an anxiety disorder, the fear or nervousness does not
go away and can get worse over time, affecting daily activities such as job performance, school-work, and
relationships.\
Triggers for anxiety disorders can range from environmental factors, genetics, brain chemistry, medical
factors, to a combination of these. There are several types of anxiety disorders, including generalized
anxiety disorder, panic disorder, specific phobias, agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, and separation anxiety
disorder. Treatment options for these disorders include a combination of psychotherapy, behavioral therapy,
and medications.\
Virtual Reality has emerged as a transformative tool in the treatment of anxiety disorders, offering immersive
therapeutic experiences that can simulate real-world scenarios in a controlled environment. By exposing
patients to stimuli or situations that trigger anxiety, VR allows for gradual habituation and desensitization,
making it a potent complement to traditional cognitive-behavioral therapies. For instance, Opris et al. (2012)
demonstrated that VR exposure therapy (VRET) significantly reduced post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms in 
military personnel. Similarly, a study by Maples-Keller et al. (2017) found that VRET can be as
effective as in vivo exposure for the treatment of acrophobia. Furthermore, Lindner et al. (2017) showcased
the potential of using VR in treating social anxiety disorders, particularly in enhancing public speaking
skills. The continued integration of VR into therapeutic practices showcases its potential to revolutionize the
treatment landscape for anxiety disorders.


#### Rationale
The rationale for this research is the use VR for treatment of different types of anxiety disorders. As there 
is no research with the general public and all types of anxiety disorders in mind this research plans to fill 
that void of knowledge. The research existing prior to this involved specific types of anxiety disorder that
appears in soldiers or something like arachnophobia. As that is the case further investigating the possibility 
that VR is better at curing anxiety disorder would be useful knowledge as it would enable treatment to be more 
effective. Contrary to the usefulness of that knowledge the study was conducted in a singular facility in one 
place and as such there is no guarantee no mater how convincing the result that there will not be discrepancies
as different parts of the world could be different and make the whole conclusion and point of the research 
worthless in a part of the world although that would be minimized as there exist different research that would 
support the outcome by confirming the minimal difference between people around the world. As the outcomes of the 
other anxiety disorder based research had an outcome where the VR was the more effective solution that is also 
expected here and as such we can roughly predict the possible outcome before the research is conducted.

####  Hypothesis
As mentioned above the educated guess for the result of this research would be a result where the group using the 
VR treatment would get much better treatment results than the group using traditional treatment methods.

### Method
#### Participants
```{r}
# Install packages
library(dplyr)

```
Hypothesis: No change in GAD scores following VR therapy

Ho = 0

```{r}
# Show all values and check if numeric
pretrial_GAD <- c(GROUP_3_2023_GCA_RESULTS_CONTROL.csv$pretrial_GAD)
pretrial_GAD
is.numeric(GROUP_3_2023_GCA_RESULTS_CONTROL.csv$pretrial_GAD)

```
```{r}
# Boxplot showing outlier in control pre-trial GAD scores
boxplot(GROUP_3_2023_GCA_RESULTS_CONTROL.csv$pretrial_GAD)
```


```{r}
# Get positive values
CtrPos_pretrial_GAD <- pretrial_GAD[pretrial_GAD >= 0]
CtrPos_pretrial_GAD

```
Histogram shows data once cleaned with negative value, one value in the control pre-trial set and one in the experiment post trial set, is removed is normally distributed and unimodal. This is true for all four datasets once data is cleaned.

```{r}
# Histogram of positive pretrial GAD values
pretrial_GAD <- c(dataCA1Control$pretrial_GAD)
pretrial_GAD
CtrPos_pretrial_GAD <- pretrial_GAD[pretrial_GAD >= 0]
CtrPos_pretrial_GAD
hist(CtrPos_pretrial_GAD,
     main = "Control positive pre-trial GAD scores",
     xlab = "Positive pre-trial GAD scores")


```

```{r}
# Anderson Darling test for normality - Positive pretrial GAD values for control data

#install and load nortest library
install.packages('nortest')
library(nortest)

ad.test(CtrPos_pretrial_GAD)
```

Anderson-Darling normality test for positive pre-trial GAD values for control data

data:  CtrPos_pretrial_GAD
A = 1.0512, p-value = 0.008746

A p value below .05 leads us to reject the null hypothesis that the data are normally distributed. This seems to contradict the appearance of a normal distribution shown in the histogram

```{r}
# Check if control post-trial data is numeric
dataCA1Control <- read.csv("GROUP_3_2023_GCA_RESULTS_CONTROL.csv")
Ctrposttrial_GAD <- c(dataCA1Control$posttrial_GAD)
is.numeric(Ctrposttrial_GAD)

```


```{r}
# Anderson Darling test for normality - Post-trial GAD values for control data

#load nortest library
library(nortest)

ad.test(Ctrposttrial_GAD)
```
A p value greater than .05 indicates the post-trial GAD values for control data are normally distributed

```{r}
# Check if experiment pre-trial data is numeric
dataCA1Experiment <- read.csv("GROUP_3_2023_GCA_RESULTS_EXPERIMENTAL.csv")
Exppretrial_GAD <- c(dataCA1Experiment$pretrial_GAD)
is.numeric(Exppretrial_GAD)

```

```{r}
# Anderson Darling test for normality - Pre-trial GAD values for experiment data

#load nortest library
library(nortest)

ad.test(Exppretrial_GAD)
```
P value less than .05 indicates experiment pre-trial data are not normally distributed


```{r}
# Check experiment post-trial data is numeric
dataCA1Experiment <- read.csv("GROUP_3_2023_GCA_RESULTS_EXPERIMENTAL.csv")
Expposttrial_GAD <- c(dataCA1Experiment$posttrial_GAD)
is.numeric(Expposttrial_GAD)

```
```{r}
# Boxplot of experiment post-trial data showing outlier
boxplot(Expposttrial_GAD)
```


```{r}
# Get positive experiment post-trial values
ExpPos_posttrial_GAD <- Expposttrial_GAD[Expposttrial_GAD >= 0]
ExpPos_posttrial_GAD
is.numeric(ExpPos_posttrial_GAD)
```
```{r}
# Histogram of postive experiment post trial values
hist(ExpPos_posttrial_GAD,
main = "Experiment positive post-trial GAD scores",
xlab = "Positive post-trial GAD scores")

```

```{r}
# Anderson Darling test for normality - Positive Post-trial GAD values for experiment data

#load nortest library
library(nortest)

ad.test(ExpPos_posttrial_GAD)
```
A p value less that .05 indicates positive Post-trial GAD values for experiment data are not normally distributed


```{r}
# Summary of Experiment data
dataCA1Experiment <- read.csv("GROUP_3_2023_GCA_RESULTS_EXPERIMENTAL.csv")
summary(dataCA1Experiment)
